quote = ' - about the women defending the Paris commune:\n\t "A supposedly weak woman knows better than any man how to say ‘it must be done’. She may feel ripped open to her very womb, but she remains unmoved. Without hate, without anger, without pity for herself or others, whether her heart bleeds or not, she can say ‘it must be done.’ Such were the women of the Commune… [who] erected and defended the barricade at Place Blanche – and held it till they died."'
