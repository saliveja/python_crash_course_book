# comments in code
# say hello to everyone.
print("Hello Python People!")


name = "Elsa"
print(name.upper())

# after writing the code about name changes it can be useful to share what didn't work for example I often forget to put () after name.upper which leads to an error message. I will from now on, share the thoughts, what worked and didn't within the program. I also see that there is an inconsistency in how I name commits.
