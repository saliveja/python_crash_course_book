# a simple dictionary
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
# dictionary storing different values about a particular item
print(alien_0['color'])
print(alien_0['points'])
# printing 'green' and '5'
# a dictionary wrapps the information in {}
# a key-value pair is a set of value associated with each other
# every key is connected to its value by a colon
# the key-value pairs are separated by commas
# one key value pair is {'color': 'green'}
# 'color' is a key and the value is 'green'
# we can store as many as we want
