Python coding

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

python --> means 2.7.3
python3 --> means 3.10.1

***

print("Hello")
# will show "Hello" in the terminal window

message = "Hello"
print(message)

# will give the same result, but this time we used a variable

print --> is a function
message --> is a variable
"Hello" --> is the value of the variable
# text that is not code is shown in orange

variables
# variables can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They cannot start with a number
# variable names cannot contain spaces, instad we can use underscore
# don't use python programming words to describe variables
# variable names should be consise, but understandable
# be careful to use letter l and O because they can be confused with 1 and 0
 
 # strings
 # a string is a series of characters which can have single or double quotes, ie. "this is the text", or 'this is the text'
 
 upper --> capital letters
 lower --> small letters
 title --> First letter in first and second name is in capital letters
 
name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.title())
# this will print Ada Lovelace

name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.upper())
# this will print ADA LOVELACE

# combining strings is called concatenation

# adding whitespace & tabs to strings
\t - tab
\n - return, add whitespace between the lines

# remove whitespace
rstrip() --> stripping whitespace on the right side of the string
lstrip() --> stripping whitespace on the left side of the string
strip() --> stripping whitespace on both sides of the string

# printing a .py file directly in terminal instead from geany
- go to the right folder cd xx/xx
- python nameoffile.py

# print
- first write all variables, then print
name = "emma goldman"
print(name)

#numbers

3**2 --> means 3 elevated to 2
examples:
3**3=27 (3*3*3)
6**4+1296 (6*6*6*6)
# for every calculation Python return a result
# numbers with a decimal point is called a float

#str() function

age = 23
message = "Happy birthday + str(age) + "rd birthday!"
print(message)
# if we use the variable without str(), Pyhton don't understand how to interpret it
# for calculations in Geany, we use:
print(8+3) to show result in terminal window

# comments
# if we want to commnt out project in Python we can use #, Python will ignore what follows after this

# say hello to everyone.
print("Hello Pyhton People")
- Pyhton will only interpret and print the second line.

# lists
[] --> indicates a list
# elements in the list are separated by comma
['shoes', jacket' , 'gloves']
# if we want to refer to a specific element in the list we write:
colors = ['red' , 'green' , 'white' , 'black']
print(colors[0])
# the first element on the list is numbered 0 (index)
# we can add upper, lower or title to format the element
colors = ['red' , 'green' , 'white' , 'black']
print(colors[0].title())

bicycles = ['trek' , 'cannondale' , 'redline' , 'specialized']
print(bicycles[-1])
# -1 shows the last element on the list
# -2 shows the second last item om the list
# -3 returns the third item from the end and so forth.

# changing, adding and removing elements from the list
example:

motorcycles = ['honda','yamaha','suzuki']
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
print(motorcycles)

# with motorcycles[0] = 'ducati' we change the value of the fist item on the list, from honda to ducati.

# append means to add an item, insert mean to at at the specified places in the list. Appending is useful if we don't have the complete list from the beginning and want to add continuously. Insert us useful if we already have a list but need to add something and it needs to be in a specific order.

# removing elements from the list
- can be done according to position or value
- del statement is removal
- example: 
del motorcycles[0] --> indicates which position is the list should be removed

# pop() method
- With the pop method you can choose any position in the list to print. 
first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)
print(motorcycles.title())
- we can use both pop() and [x] to point to a position in a list, but pop will remove the item while [x] will not
- we can use both del and pop() to remove an iten from a list. If we want to continue to work with the removed ite, we need to use pop() method

# Removing item by value
- remove() method can be used when we want to remove an item without knowing it's position.
list.remove('whateveritemwewanttoremovefromthelist') 
- to be able to understand why we are using remove() we can name the variable and we can point to the variable to print statments about it.
- remove() only removes the first value and if we want it to remove a value every time it occurs, we need a loop

# printing a message to people on a list
guests = ['Kerstin' , 'Elsa' , 'Erika' , 'mother' , 'Louise' , 'Marie' , 'Birgitta' , 'Sandra']
print("Hello " + guests[2] + message + "\n")
